# MAE-598-Project-2-Racetrack-Optimization

This code is the second partto the original race track optimization code in my repository. This portion adds more depth by involving acceleration and deceleration. 
That means that the car is able to change its speed instead of going around the track at a constant velocity. This is still a work in progress and the logic for when to accelerate and decelerate 
exists in this code, however does not properly get applied to the loss function. More in depth coding and debugging is required but this is a first pass.
